About
===========
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple method to: 
- create a voxelised phantom from a parameter file or image using STIR functionality
- setup and run Gate in cluster array jobs
- combine and unlist root files for reconstruction using STIR


Directories
===========

* `ExamplesOfScannersMacros/`: Contains examples of macros for creating a scanner in GATE.
* `ExamplesOfPhantomMacros/`: Contains examples of macros and STIR parameter files for creating/importing source and attenuation phantoms.
* `VoxelisedSimulation/`: Main GATE simulation directory.


Acknowledgements
================
Additional help with testing an early stage of the macros:
- Catherine Scott (UCL/UCLH)
- Ana Margarida Motta (Universidade de Lisboa)
